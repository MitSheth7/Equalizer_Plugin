# Overview 
This undertaking employs the C++ programming language alongside the JUCE framework to engineer a high-level audio equalizer plugin, featuring bespoke notches for each band equalizer, as well as a spectrum analyzer. JUCE plays a vital role in constructing the desktop application for this audio plugin and serves as a reliable host for the plugin itself.

# Attributes 
This project is dedicated to the development of a sophisticated 3-band equalizer plugin, designed to meet the demands of discerning audio professionals. Among its key features are low and high cut bands, each with sliders that allow for precise control of frequency and cut steepness. Additionally, the parametric band controls notches or boosts, granting users the ability to customize their width and frequency settings.

For added convenience, the plugin includes bypass buttons that can disable specific bands (high, low, and parametric), saving valuable CPU usage. The plugin also incorporates a powerful spectrum analyzer that allows users to visualize the audio they are hearing in real-time. The spectrum analyzer comes equipped with a bypass button, as well as a filter response curve that enables users to identify any changes made to the original audio.

Overall, this plugin provides users with a comprehensive suite of features that will enable them to achieve their desired sound with precision and ease.
